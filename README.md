# Overview

This is a game is a monster catcher game. The goal of the game is to collect monsters from around the map. The game is built so a player walks around the map and in certain areas they have a chance of encountering a monster! If they encounter a monster, they can choose to run or catch the monster.

# Development Environment

This project was developed with the Unity game framework. We used C# for the scripts. We connected our Unity game to a Firebase real-time database. We used Firebase to store the users caught monster stats that will eventually be used to create the user's backpack.
